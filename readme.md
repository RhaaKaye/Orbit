## Info

[Visual Poi 2nd Version](https://github.com/InvisiBug/Orbit/releases/tag/v2)

This is my version of [Visual Poi](https://www.lighttoys.cz/product/visual-poi-v4-classic/) which were mad expensive so I made my own

Shout out to [Pov Pixel Poi PJRC forum thread](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/30020-Teensy-APA102-POV-Poi-Pixel-Poi-Build-Tutorial) I couldn't have made these without them

The Poi uses a teensy 3.2, a strip of APA201 LEDs and a TP4056 LiPo charger
